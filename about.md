## Background

Security researcher and offensive security practitioner with focus on red team operations, adversary emulation, and detection engineering.

This site serves as a platform for documenting technical research, sharing tradecraft analysis, and contributing to the security community's understanding of offensive techniques and defensive strategies.

## Research Philosophy

Research documented here emphasizes:

- Technical accuracy and reproducibility
- Detection and defensive considerations
- Operational security trade-offs
- Real-world applicability

The goal is to contribute meaningful research that advances both offensive capabilities and defensive understanding.

## Approach

Technical content follows a structured methodology:

1. **Analysis**: Deep examination of techniques, tools, and tradecraft
2. **Detection**: Identification of artifacts, telemetry, and visibility opportunities
3. **Context**: Operational considerations and real-world constraints
4. **Assessment**: Trade-off analysis and decision frameworks
