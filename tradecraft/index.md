## Research & Tradecraft

Technical analysis of offensive security methodologies, detection engineering, and operational tradecraft. Each research entry examines techniques from both adversarial and defensive perspectives, focusing on implementation details, operational trade-offs, and detection visibility.

### Redirecting the Adversary
**Designing resilient red team command-and-control infrastructure using redirectors and reverse proxies**

An examination of modern red team infrastructure design, focusing on layered redirectors, NGINX and Apache reverse proxy configurations, operational tradeoffs, and detection considerations in real-world environments.

**Status:** Coming Soon

### Abusing Trust at Load Time
**DLL sideloading as a tradecraft problem rather than a payload problem**

A tradecraft-focused analysis of DLL sideloading techniques, exploring execution context, trust boundaries, operational reliability, and defensive visibility across modern Windows environments.

**Status:** Coming Soon

### Inside the Process Boundary
**Accessing LSASS in the presence of modern protections**

A research-driven look at LSASS access techniques, including privilege requirements, protection mechanisms such as PPL, and the evolving detection landscape surrounding credential access.

**Status:** Coming Soon

---

### Harvesting Local Secrets
**SAM access under modern endpoint defenses**

An exploration of local credential storage access, focusing on SAM extraction techniques, operational constraints imposed by modern EDR solutions, and defensive telemetry considerations.

**Status:** Coming Soon

## Research Approach

All research follows a structured methodology that considers:

- **Technical Implementation**: Detailed analysis of technique mechanics and variations
- **Operational Context**: Real-world applicability and reliability considerations
- **Detection Visibility**: Telemetry sources, artifacts, and defensive opportunities
- **Trade-off Analysis**: OPSEC considerations and decision frameworks

Research is published for defensive purposes and to advance detection engineering capabilities. Full articles will be added as research is completed and documented.
