## Article Structure

Technical research follows a consistent format:

**Background**: Context and technique overview  
**Implementation**: Technical details and variations  
**Detection**: Artifacts, telemetry, and visibility opportunities  
**Operational Considerations**: OPSEC trade-offs and decision points  
**Defensive Recommendations**: Detection strategies and mitigations  

This structure ensures comprehensive coverage from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
